            <p class="lead">A version control system is ultimately a project monitor that records any and every change that is made during the process of personal and group projects in a repository. These software tools help manage the changes that are happening over time so that the coder or programmer can go back and monitor every thing that has happened to their project. A version control system helps teams who are working together to develop a project keep track of who is contributing what to the final product. This helps to eliminate confusion and confrontation and helps resolve any problems related to the project in a timely and respectable manner.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Within the Git repository system, there are what are known as Basic Commands. Basic Commands are the commands/rules that are needed in order to get the project up and running. Without most of these commands, you could risk losing important files on your local or remote repository if you forget to include them during your work. For instance, you need to tell the system who you are. Even though your local and remote repository may be connected or linked together, it is important for the system to know where it is pushing and pulling files from. Another basic command that is very useful throughout the working process is the status command. With this tool, you never have to guess or worry about which of your files are where. The status command will list which files have been altered and which ones that need to be committed or added remain, which I think is pretty cool and helps keep things organized.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Within the Git repository system there are also Remote Commands. Remote Commands are not like basic commands. I look at remote commands as the actions you want to call on your system. For example, if I were to enter the Git command 'git push,' I am asking the system to send or push any changes that have been made back to the master/origin. Another command that is useful is the remote command. With the remote command, I can connect to my local repository and ask the system to list all current remote repositories so that I know what all I am dealing with. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In this lesson, I also learned how to track new files within Git. Git is able to take any file name that you give it and ultimately cover it before finalization. Tracking new files on the system is one of the steps for recording changes to the repository. In order to track new files, the Git command 'git add' needs to be executed. In the terminal though, you have to be sure to state which file you specifically want to be tracked. After tracking the file it  is staged to be committed. I think that this, and the Git repository system in itself, is just making sure everything that we want to keep or save is done so correctly.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is a Repository?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is a location system that is used to store and retrieve packets, packages, and projects that are being worked on. Instead oh having all of the different file types that someone may be working on on their personal devices storage, a repository is there to keep everything together in one place without the fear of losing information. Particular software programs use specific repository systems that are useful to their coding environments. One advantage that some may not like about a repository system is that it can sometimes be public. Having a public repository basically means that it open to anyone who has access to view your files that you may not want to share with others. Some repository systems are able to be private, but this could also limit the amount of changes and feedback you may be getting on your project. If using a repository, be sure to choose a system that works for you. </p>
